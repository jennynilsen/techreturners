# Namespaces

#### What is a namespace
We have see namespaces in Linux , which ideally isolates objects and here also the concept is same but serves a different purpose.
Suppose you have two departments in you organization and both departments have application which needs more fine grained control.
We can use namespaces to separate the workload of each departments.

By default kubernetes will have three namespace

#### List namespace
```shell
$ kubectl get ns
NAME          STATUS   AGE
default       Active   39h
kube-public   Active   39h
kube-system   Active   39h
```

default : All Pods that we manually create will go to this namespace (There are ways to change it , but for now that is what it is).
kube-public : All common workloads can be assigned to this namespace . Most of the time no-one use it.
kube-system : Kubernetes specific Pods will be running on this namespace

#### List Pods in kube-system namespace
```shell
$ kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
calico-node-n99tb                       2/2     Running   0          38h
calico-node-nkcrd                       2/2     Running   0          38h
coredns-86c58d9df4-4c22l                1/1     Running   0          39h
coredns-86c58d9df4-b49c2                1/1     Running   0          39h
etcd-k8s-master-01                      1/1     Running   0          39h
kube-apiserver-k8s-master-01            1/1     Running   0          39h
kube-controller-manager-k8s-master-01   1/1     Running   0          39h
kube-proxy-s6hc4                        1/1     Running   0          38h
kube-proxy-tzznm                        1/1     Running   0          39h
kube-scheduler-k8s-master-01            1/1     Running   0          39h
```

As you can see , there are many Pods running in `kube-system` namespace
All these Pods were running with one or mode containers
If you see the `calico-node-n99tb` pod , the `READY` says 2/2 , which means two containers were running fine in this Pod

#### List all resources in a namespace
```shell
k8s@k8s-master-01:~$ kubectl get all -n kube-system
